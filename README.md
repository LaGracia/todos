## Description

This is the final Udacity miniproject for JavaScript Design Patterns. It uses the Backbone and Underscore JS libraries.

### Project details

This app builds from the Todo List app created by Jérôme Gravel-Niquet, which is bundled with the [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/#examples) framework. My additions are:
- A flag icon to mark a todo item as a priority
- Color coding for priority items
- The ability to view items on the priority list
- Customized CSS, including hacks for Firefox

### Credits

Unlike most of my Udacity projects, this one owes much of its success to the excellent videos, which give clear instructions for how to proceed at every stage, so props to course instructor Ben Jaffe. Many thanks also to eferdman on GitHub for the code to show only priority items.

### License

I do not own Todo List. Some of the edits to the original app were done for the course, and others are my work. This repository is licensed under [GitHub’s terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/), meaning you can view and fork it.

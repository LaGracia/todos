## Description

This is the final Udacity miniproject for JavaScript Design Patterns. It uses the Backbone and Underscore JS libraries.

### Project details

This app builds from the Todo List app created by Jérôme Gravel-Niquet, which is bundled with the [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/#examples) framework.

### Credits

Unlike most (if not all) of my Udacity projects, this one actually owes its success to the excellent videos, which give clear instructions for how to proceed at every stage, so I never had to consult the forum at all. Props to Ben Jaffe, the course instructor.

### License

I do not own Todo List. Some of the edits to the original app were done for the course, and some were my work. This repository is licensed under [GitHub’s terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/), meaning you can view and fork it.
